# Getting Set Up



(Old instructions, using virtual environments)

Start up Anaconda prompt

To create a virtual environment called sandbox:

conda create -n sandbox python=3.9

conda activate sandbox

pip install streamlit


conda activate sandbox
steamlit myapp

or
streamlit hello

Voice option:
create go.bat:
conda activate sandbox
streamlit run myappname.py

Put in a batch file:
cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\GitHub\streamlit-play
conda run -n sandbox streamlit run app.py

NOTE:
To stop the streamlit server, leave the app browser open, go to the command line that spawned it, and hit Ctrl-C twice
